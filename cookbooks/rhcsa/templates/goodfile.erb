White supremacy or white supremacism is the racist belief that white people are superior to people of other races and therefore should be dominant over them. 
White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. 
Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews.
The term is also used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical, or institutional domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws in the United States, the set of "White Australia" policies from the 1890s until the mid-1970s, and apartheid in South Africa).
Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.
In academic usage, particularly in usage which draws on critical race theory or intersectionality, the term "white supremacy" can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system, in which white people enjoy a structural advantage (privilege) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level.
